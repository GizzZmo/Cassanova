## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- **Authentication Context** (`frontend/lib/auth-context.tsx`):
  - React Context API for global authentication state
  - localStorage persistence for user data and JWT token
  - Login, logout, and authentication status functions
  - Used across all protected routes

### API Client
- **API Library** (`frontend/lib/api.ts`):
  - Centralized API client
  - Organized endpoints by domain:
    - Auth: register, login
    - Games: getAll, getBySlug, getJackpots
    - Promotions: getAll, getBySlug
    - Transactions: getAll, deposit, withdraw
    - User: getProfile
  - Configurable base URL via environment variable
  - JWT token handling for authenticated requests

### TypeScript Types
- **Type Definitions** (`frontend/types/index.ts`):
  - `User`: User profile and account data
  - `Game`: Game information and metadata
  - `Promotion`: Promotion details and terms
  - `Transaction`: Transaction history records
  - Strongly typed for better development experience

### Styling & Design
- **Consistent Design System**:
  - Uses Tailwind CSS matching existing Cassanova theme
  - Purple/pink gradients for backgrounds
  - Yellow/gold accents for CTAs and highlights
  - Glassmorphism effects (backdrop-blur)
  - Responsive grid layouts
  - Smooth transitions and hover effects
  - Accessibility-friendly color contrasts

### Image Optimization
- **Next.js Image Configuration** (`frontend/next.config.ts`):
  - Configured remote image patterns to support external images
  - Uses Next.js `<Image>` component for optimized loading
  - Responsive image sizing
  - Lazy loading by default

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Protected routes redirect to login when unauthenticated
- ✅ JWT token validation on backend API calls
- ✅ Secure password handling (never stored in plain text)
- ✅ Session persistence via localStorage with token expiry

### Input Validation
- ✅ Client-side form validation for all inputs
- ✅ Password strength requirements
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ Amount range validation for transactions
- ✅ XSS protection via React's built-in escaping

### Financial Security
- ✅ KYC verification required for withdrawals
- ✅ Balance validation before withdrawal
- ✅ Transaction amount limits enforced
- ✅ Secure payment method selection

### Code Quality
- ✅ Zero ESLint errors
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ Zero CodeQL security vulnerabilities detected
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ All images optimized

## Testing Performed

### Build & Lint Tests
- ✅ `npm run build` - Successful production build
- ✅ `npm run lint` - Zero errors, zero warnings
- ✅ TypeScript compilation - No type errors
- ✅ CodeQL security scan - No vulnerabilities

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Login page renders correctly
- ✅ Register page renders correctly
- ✅ Form validation works as expected
- ✅ Protected routes redirect appropriately
- ✅ Dynamic routes work for games and promotions
- ✅ Responsive design verified on multiple screen sizes
- ✅ All links and navigation function correctly
